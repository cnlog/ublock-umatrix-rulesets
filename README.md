# uBlock & uMatrix Rulesets

Personal uBlock & uMatrix rulesets.

Please note that the uBlock rulesets are very opinionated.
The uMatrix recipes are built assuming the following default rules:

```
no-workers: * true
* * * block
* 1st-party css allow
* 1st-party image allow
* 1st-party frame allow
```

These are more restrictive than the ones proposed by uMatrix.
